Embedded UI generator

Generate an HTML UI at compile-time which can display and edit a single rust struct.
* install / run

cargo install --locked trunk

cd frontend
trunk build
toast dev-frontend

* roadmap

- control a single LED via editing an rgb struct with <input type="numeric" min="0" max="255">
- add two-variant enum, Off and On(RGB{...})

* implementation options

JSON Schema generated on rust types via https://docs.rs/schemars/latest/schemars/ 
then generate UI
- jQuery forms http://www.alpacajs.org/
- react https://rjsf-team.github.io/react-jsonschema-form/
  - this doesn't quite get enum variant UI right.

postcard + schema? https://github.com/jamesmunns/postcard/issues/92


similar-ish idea in Rust: UI controls defined in firmware for a web UI: https://github.com/spookyvision/embedded-web-ui
